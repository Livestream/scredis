# scredis

Scredis is a reactive, non-blocking and ultra-fast Scala [Redis](http://redis.io) client built on top of Akka IO. 
It has been (and still is) extensively used in production at Livestream.

* [Documentation](https://github.com/Livestream/scredis/wiki)
* [Scaladoc](http://livestream.github.io/scredis/api/snapshot/)

## Features
* Supports all Redis commands up to v3.0.0
* Built on top of Akka non-blocking IO
* Super fast, see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) section below
* Automatic reconnection
* Automatic pipelining
* Transactions
* Pub/Sub
  * Subscribe selectively with partial functions
  * Tracked Subscribe and Unsubscribe commands (they return a Future as any other commands)
  * Automatically resubscribes to previously subscribed channels/patterns upon reconnection
* Cluster support via `RedisCluster`
* Customizable serialization and deserialization of command inputs and outputs
* Fully configurable
  * Akka dispatchers
  * Pipelined write batch size
  * Receive timeout
  * TCP buffer size hints
  * Request encoding buffer pool
  * Concurrent requests cap (bounded memory consumption)

## Getting started

### Binaries
Scredis 2.x.x is compatible with Scala 2.10 and 2.11. Binary releases are hosted on the Sonatype Central Repository.

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"

libraryDependencies += "com.livestream" %% "scredis" % "2.0.6"
```

Snapshots are hosted on a separate repository.

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"

libraryDependencies += "com.livestream" %% "scredis" % "2.0.6-SNAPSHOT"
```

### Quick example
```scala
import scredis._
import scala.util.{ Success, Failure }

// Creates a Redis instance with default configuration.
// See reference.conf for the complete list of configurable parameters.
val redis = Redis()

// Import internal ActorSystem's dispatcher (execution context) to register callbacks
import redis.dispatcher

// Executing a non-blocking command and registering callbacks on the returned Future
redis.hGetAll("my-hash") onComplete {
  case Success(content) => println(content)
  case Failure(e) => e.printStackTrace()
}

// Executes a blocking command using the internal, lazily initialized BlockingClient
redis.blocking.blPop(0, "queue")

// Subscribes to a Pub/Sub channel using the internal, lazily initialized SubscriberClient
redis.subscriber.subscribe("My Channel") {
  case message @ PubSubMessage.Message(channel, messageBytes) => println(
    message.readAs[String]()
  )
  case PubSubMessage.Subscribe(channel, subscribedChannelsCount) => println(
    s"Successfully subscribed to $channel"
  )
}

// Shutdown all initialized internal clients along with the ActorSystem
redis.quit()
```

## Benchmarks

The following benchmarks have been performed using [ScalaMeter](http://scalameter.github.io/) with the 
`SeparateJvmsExecutor`, configured with `Warmer.Default`, `Measurer.Default` and `Aggregator.average`.
The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Livestream/scredis/blob/master/src/test/scala/scredis/ClientBenchmark.scala).

### Scala
Scala 2.11.2

### Scredis
2.0.0-RC1 with default configuration

### Redis

## Developing

### Running the tests

The tests require two Redis instances to be running with some specific configuration options set. 
They can be started with the start-redis-test-instances.sh script.
